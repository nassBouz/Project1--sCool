    aboutSchool: "Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. This is a fantastic little painting. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. There he comes. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.",

There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.",

Let's build an almighty mountain. Little short strokes. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. This is your world.

We are just playing here. And maybe, maybe, maybe... Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. At home you have unlimited time. Little short strokes. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.",
